# Spam-Detection-in-SMS

Introduction:
  This project spam detection in SMS classifies the spam massages from original messages.The SMS spam collection data set is used for testing the method.Use of a dataset to train the machine learning.The project experimental results have shown that this model outperforms previous models in spam detection with an accuracy of good.
Finally it visualize with a UI page to show case the entered SMS message is a spam or not spam.

Tools Used :
  * Jupyter Notebook
  * scikitlearn
  * Machine learning
  * Python - numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn

Project Modules:

  *Data Collection 
  *Data Pre-processing
  *Feature Extraction
  *Splitting of data 
  *Training 
  *Testing
  *Visualization - graphs,plots,UI web page

Algorithm :

   In this project Support Vector Machine [SVM] classifier algorithm is implemented.

Conclution:

  The analytical process started from data cleaning and processing, missing value, exploratory analysis and finally model building and evaluation. The best accuracy on public test set is higher accuracy score will be found out. This project can help to find the Prediction of SMS spam messages with spam or not spam detection.
